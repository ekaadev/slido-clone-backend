# WebSocket & Real-time

## Overview

All real-time updates use a single WebSocket connection per client, multiplexed by event type. The hub manages room-scoped connections. Most mutations happen over HTTP and then broadcast via WebSocket; some client actions (chat, typing, Q&A submit/upvote) can also be initiated via WebSocket.

## Architecture

- **Hub:** `internal/delivery/websocket/hub.go`
- **Client:** `internal/delivery/websocket/client.go`
- **Event Handler:** `internal/delivery/websocket/event_handler.go`
- **WebSocket Handler:** `internal/delivery/websocket/handler.go`
- **Message Types:** `internal/delivery/websocket/message.go`

## Connection Setup

```
GET /ws?token={jwt_token}
```

- Token must be a valid, room-scoped JWT containing `RoomID` and `ParticipantID` claims
- Obtain a room-scoped token via `POST /rooms/:room_code/join` or `POST /users/anonymous`
- On connect: client is registered with the hub into their room bucket
- On disconnect: client is unregistered; `room:user_left` is broadcast to the room

## Hub Architecture

```go
Hub {
    rooms    map[uint]map[*Client]bool  // roomID → set of clients
    register   chan *Client
    unregister chan *Client
    broadcast  chan BroadcastMessage
}
```

`hub.BroadcastToRoom(roomID, message)` — sends a message to all connected clients in a room. Thread-safe via channel routing. Clients with full send buffers are silently skipped (logged as warning).

## Client Read/Write Pumps

Each client has two goroutines:
- **ReadPump:** Reads incoming messages (max 512 KB), passes to `EventHandler.HandleMessage`
- **WritePump:** Sends outgoing messages from buffered channel; sends ping every 54 seconds; closes on pong timeout (60s)

## Message Format

All WebSocket messages are JSON:
```json
{
  "event": "event:name",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

## EventHandler Routing

`EventHandler.HandleMessage()` dispatches by `event` field:

| Incoming Event | Handler Method | Action |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| `message:send` | `handleMessageSend` | Calls MessageUseCase.Send, broadcasts `message:new`, updates leaderboard |
| `chat:typing` | `handleChatTyping` | Broadcasts typing status to room (excluding sender) |
| `leaderboard:request` | `handleLeaderboardRequest` | Sends leaderboard to requesting client only |
| `question:submit` | `handleQuestionSubmit` | Calls QuestionUseCase.Submit, broadcasts `question:created` |
| `question:upvote` | `handleQuestionUpvote` | Calls QuestionUseCase.Upvote, broadcasts `question:upvoted` |
| `question:remove_upvote` | `handleQuestionRemoveUpvote` | Calls QuestionUseCase.RemoveUpvote, broadcasts `question:upvoted` |
| `webrtc:offer` | `handleWebrtcOffer` | Creates/renegotiates peer via SFU |
| `webrtc:answer` | `handleWebrtcAnswer` | Processes SDP answer |
| `webrtc:candidate` | `handleWebrtcCandidate` | Processes ICE candidate |
| `conference:start` | `handleConferenceStart` | Starts conference (room owner only) |
| `conference:stop` | `handleConferenceStop` | Stops conference (room owner only) |
| `conference:join` | `handleConferenceJoin` | Sends current state to joining client |
| `conference:leave` | `handleConferenceLeave` | Broadcasts user left |
| `conference:raise_hand` | `handleRaiseHand` | Adds to raised hands list, broadcasts |
| `conference:lower_hand` | `handleLowerHand` | Removes from raised hands, broadcasts |
| `conference:promote` | `handlePromoteSpeaker` | Adds to speakers (host only) |
| `conference:demote` | `handleDemoteSpeaker` | Removes from speakers (host only) |

## Broadcasting Pattern in Controllers

Controllers that need to broadcast receive the hub as a dependency:
```go
// After a Q&A action:
hub.BroadcastToRoom(roomID, websocket.Message{
    Event: websocket.EventQuestionCreated,
    Data:  questionResponse,
})

// After any XP-awarding action:
broadcastLeaderboardUpdate(hub, roomID)
```

`broadcastLeaderboardUpdate` is a helper that fetches the updated leaderboard and broadcasts `leaderboard:updated` to the room.
