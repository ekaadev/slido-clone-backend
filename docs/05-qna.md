# Q&A (Questions)

## Overview

The core feature for quality interaction. Designed as a structured forum for audience members to submit questions, insights, or ideas. Contributions here are the primary basis for the XP gamification system. Questions go through a moderation/validation workflow by the presenter.

## Architecture

- **Controller:** `internal/delivery/http/question_controller.go`
- **Use Case:** `internal/usecase/question_usecase.go`
- **Repository:** `internal/repository/question_repository.go`, `internal/repository/vote_repository.go`
- **Entity:** `internal/entity/question_entity.go`, `internal/entity/vote_entity.go`
- **Model/DTO:** `internal/model/question_model.go`
- **Converter:** `internal/model/converter/question_converter.go`

## Data Model

### Question Entity (`questions` table)
| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| ID | uint | Primary key |
| RoomID | uint | FK → rooms.id, indexed |
| ParticipantID | uint | FK → participants.id, indexed |
| Content | text | Question text |
| UpvoteCount | uint | Denormalized, managed by DB trigger |
| Status | enum | `pending`, `answered`, `highlighted`, indexed |
| IsValidatedByPresenter | bool | Default false, indexed |
| XPAwarded | uint | Total XP given for this question |
| CreatedAt | time.Time | Indexed |

### Vote Entity (`votes` table)
| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| ID | uint | Primary key |
| QuestionID | uint | FK → questions.id, indexed |
| ParticipantID | uint | FK → participants.id, indexed |
| CreatedAt | time.Time | Indexed |
| Unique | — | (QuestionID, ParticipantID) — one upvote per participant per question |

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/v1/rooms/:room_id/questions
- **Auth:** Required
- **Request:** `{ content: string }`
- **Response:** `{ question: QuestionResponse, xpEarned: { points, newTotal } }`
- **Logic:** Create question; award 10 XP to author; broadcast `question:created`

### GET /api/v1/rooms/:room_id/questions
- **Auth:** Required
- **Query Params:** `status` (optional filter), `sort_by` (upvotes|recent|validated), `limit`, `offset`
- **Response:** `{ questions: QuestionResponse[], paging: { total, limit, offset } }`
- **Logic:**
  - Default sort: `upvote_count DESC, created_at DESC`
  - `recent`: `created_at DESC`
  - `validated`: `is_validated_by_presenter DESC, upvote_count DESC, created_at DESC`
  - Includes `hasVoted: bool` per question for the current participant (batch lookup via `VoteRepository.GetVotedQuestionIDs`)

### POST /api/v1/questions/:question_id/upvote
- **Auth:** Required
- **Response:** `{ vote: VoteResponse, question: { id, upvoteCount }, xpEarned: { recipientParticipantID, points, source } }`
- **Logic:**
  - Prevent self-vote (same participantID as question author)
  - Prevent duplicate vote (unique constraint enforced at DB + application level)
  - Create Vote record; DB trigger increments `questions.upvote_count`
  - Award 3 XP to question author (not voter)

### DELETE /api/v1/questions/:question_id/upvote
- **Auth:** Required
- **Response:** `{ question: { id, upvoteCount } }`
- **Logic:** Delete Vote record; DB trigger decrements `questions.upvote_count`; deduct 3 XP from question author

### PATCH /api/v1/questions/:question_id/validate
- **Auth:** Required (presenter only)
- **Request:** `{ status: "answered" | "highlighted" }`
- **Response:** `{ question: { id, status, isValidatedByPresenter }, xpAwarded: { participantID, points, newTotal } }`
- **Logic:**
  - Verify caller is room presenter
  - Set `is_validated_by_presenter = true`, update `status`
  - Award 25 XP to question author
  - Prevent re-validation (already validated questions cannot be re-validated)
  - Broadcast `question:validated`

## WebSocket Events

| Event | Direction | Payload |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `question:submit` | Client → Server | `{ content: string }` |
| `question:created` | Server → Client | `QuestionResponse` |
| `question:upvote` | Client → Server | `{ questionID: uint }` |
| `question:remove_upvote` | Client → Server | `{ questionID: uint }` |
| `question:upvoted` | Server → Client | `{ id, upvoteCount }` |
| `question:validate` | Client → Server | `{ questionID, status }` |
| `question:validated` | Server → Client | `{ id, status, isValidatedByPresenter }` |

## XP Logic

| Action | XP | Recipient | Source Type |
|--------|-----|-----------|-------------|
| Submit question | 10 XP | Question author | `question_created` |
| Receive upvote | +3 XP | Question author | `upvote_received` |
| Upvote removed | -3 XP | Question author | `upvote_received` (negative) |
| Presenter validates | 25 XP | Question author | `presenter_validated` |

## Business Rules

- A participant cannot upvote their own question
- A participant can only upvote a question once (DB unique constraint + app-level check)
- Upvote removal reverses the XP grant (negative XP transaction)
- Only the room presenter can validate questions
- A question can only be validated once (`IsValidatedByPresenter` is a one-way flag)
- `upvote_count` is managed by DB triggers; the app does NOT manually update this field
- Questions are scoped to a room; cross-room queries are not possible
