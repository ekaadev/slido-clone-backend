# Conference & WebRTC

## Overview

An optional video conferencing layer on top of the interactive QnA platform, implemented as a Pion-based Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU). The conference feature is entirely WebSocket-driven with no HTTP endpoints. It is independent of the main HTTP/domain flow and is controlled by the room owner.

## Architecture

- **SFU Package:** `internal/sfu/` — Pion WebRTC SFU implementation
- **Event Handler:** Conference methods in `internal/delivery/websocket/event_handler.go`
- **Client:** `internal/delivery/websocket/client.go` — stores `isRoomOwner` flag

The SFU is wired into the `EventHandler` but operates independently of the room/participant use cases.

## Lifecycle

```
host sends conference:start
         |
         v
Server broadcasts conference:started to room
         |
         v
Audience sends conference:join
         |
         v
Server sends conference:state to joining client
         |
         v
Participants exchange WebRTC signals (offer/answer/candidate)
         |
         v
(Optional) Host promotes audience member to speaker
         |
         v
host sends conference:stop
         |
         v
Server broadcasts conference:ended to room
```

## WebSocket Events

### Conference Control (Host Only)
| Event | Direction | Auth | Description |
|-------|-----------|------|-------------|
| `conference:start` | Client → Server | Room owner only | Start the conference session |
| `conference:started` | Server → Client | Broadcast | Conference is now active |
| `conference:stop` | Client → Server | Room owner only | Stop the conference session |
| `conference:ended` | Server → Client | Broadcast | Conference has ended |
| `conference:state` | Server → Client | Individual | Current state sent to newly joining clients |

### Audience Participation
| Event | Direction | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `conference:join` | Client → Server | Join as audience viewer |
| `conference:joined` | Server → Client | Broadcast that a participant joined |
| `conference:leave` | Client → Server | Leave the conference |
| `conference:left` | Server → Client | Broadcast that a participant left |

### Hand Raise System
| Event | Direction | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `conference:raise_hand` | Client → Server | Request to speak |
| `conference:hand_raised` | Server → Client | Broadcast someone raised hand |
| `conference:lower_hand` | Client → Server | Cancel request to speak |
| `conference:hand_lowered` | Server → Client | Broadcast hand was lowered |

### Speaker Management (Host Only)
| Event | Direction | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `conference:promote` | Client → Server | Promote audience member to speaker |
| `conference:promoted` | Server → Client | Broadcast someone was promoted |
| `conference:demote` | Client → Server | Demote speaker back to audience |
| `conference:demoted` | Server → Client | Broadcast someone was demoted |

### WebRTC Signaling
| Event | Direction | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `webrtc:offer` | Client → Server | SDP offer — creates or renegotiates a peer connection in the SFU |
| `webrtc:answer` | Server → Client | SDP answer from SFU |
| `webrtc:candidate` | Bidirectional | ICE candidate exchange |

## Authorization

Conference control actions are enforced at the `EventHandler` level via `client.isRoomOwner`:
- `conference:start`, `conference:stop` — restricted to room owner
- `conference:promote`, `conference:demote` — restricted to room owner
- All other conference events — any participant in the room

`isRoomOwner` is set when the WebSocket client connects, derived from the JWT claim.

## SFU Details

- **Library:** Pion WebRTC (`github.com/pion/webrtc`)
- **Location:** `internal/sfu/`
- The SFU acts as a media relay: publishers send tracks to the SFU, and the SFU forwards them to all subscribers
- Peer connections are managed by the SFU package and referenced by participant/client identity
- Renegotiation is triggered when new participants join or leave

## Business Rules

- Conference is independent of room status — a conference can theoretically run even after room close (no explicit validation)
- A participant can only be in one role at a time (audience or speaker)
- The raised hand queue is managed in-memory on the hub/event handler; it is not persisted to the database
- Promoting a speaker triggers a WebRTC renegotiation so the promoted participant can start sending media
- Conference events do not award XP
- Conference state is in-memory only; it is lost if the server restarts
